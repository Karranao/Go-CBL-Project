Go game.

Description:
Menu displays two two-player Go games, the first based off of the original, and the second a five-in-a-row version of the game. The players may choose between the two games, which will then open the game board for them to then play against each other. At any time during a game, the players have the option to return to the menu, and upon completing a game, the players have the same option, and may also start a new game.

Rules:
Go:
In Go, each player takes turn placing down pieces, starting with black. Points are scored by enclosing areas fully between  your own pieces, as well as the borders of the board. The game ends when both players have decided it has ended. When having decided the game has ended, the players may press the ‘End Game’ button which will automatically tally up the points each player has scored, displaying them as well as who won the game overall.

Go Scoring:
Each tile contained within a players territory, even if it belongs to the other player, counts as a point. If a territory is within the enemy players territory, it counts to the other players points unless it has at least two “eyes”. An eye is a 1 space hole within the players territory fully surrounded by the players own tiles. Areas that don’t meet any of these rules don’t count towards anyone’s points.

Five-In-A-Row:
Players take turns placing down pieces, starting with black then alternating turns. The first player to align five pieces in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins. Upon victory, the game will end and display who the winner is.





Advanced array interpretation and manipulation:
	The project involves advanced array manipulation and interpretation methods to keep track of the games and decide who has won. This includes recursive methods and complicated logic.

Game design/user experience
	The game has been designed with an intuitive user interface, allowing the players to navigate through the games/menu. Important information is shown to the user, such as who’s turn it is, or upon completion of the Go game, how many points they each got. These features ensure a smooth experience for the players playing against each other. Buttons disappear or are disabled when they may no longer be used to
